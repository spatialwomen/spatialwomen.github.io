                        We organized a unique networking event aimed at promoting diversity in computer science. Diane Oyen from Los Alamos National Laboratory gave a invited talk and shared her insights on career development, including their experiences, challenges, and strategies for success. 
                        We had the opportunity to connect with researchers from diverse backgrounds and build meaningful professional relationships while supporting diversity in the field.
